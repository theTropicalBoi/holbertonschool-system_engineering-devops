1. Load Balancer (HAProxy)
Why? Distributes traffic across multiple servers to:

Prevent overload on a single server

Improve uptime and responsiveness

Distribution Algorithm:
Round-Robin: Requests are sent to backend servers in a cyclic order.

Req 1 → App Server 1

Req 2 → App Server 2

Req 3 → App Server 1 ...

Ensures fair and simple load distribution.

Active-Active Configuration:

Both app servers are active and handling traffic simultaneously.

Ideal for high availability and scalability.

Contrast with Active-Passive, where one server is idle until the active one fails.
