1. Firewalls (3)
Why? Firewalls control incoming and outgoing network traffic, adding an essential layer of defense against unauthorized access.

Placement:

Firewall 1 (Load Balancer): Allows only HTTPS (port 443).

Firewall 2 & 3 (App Servers):

Allow traffic only from the load balancer and monitoring services.

Restrict database ports (3306) to internal IPs only.

2. SSL Certificate (HTTPS via Let's Encrypt)
Why?

Encrypts communication between the user and your website.

Prevents man-in-the-middle attacks and protects user privacy.

Served at: Load balancer (HAProxy) with automatic renewal via Let's Encrypt.
