What is a Web Server?
A web server like Nginx or Apache handles:

Receiving HTTP/HTTPS requests

Serving static content (HTML, CSS, JS, images)

Acting as a reverse proxy to the application server

Think of it as the “front door” of your website.

What is an Application Server?
An application server runs your backend code:

Executes dynamic logic (PHP, Node.js, Django, etc.)

Handles routing, API endpoints, session management

Communicates with the database

Think of it as the “brain” of your application.
