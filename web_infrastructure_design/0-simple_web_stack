What is a server?
A server is a physical or virtual computer that provides services or resources (like websites) over a network. In this setup, it runs software to handle web traffic and store the site’s data.

What is the role of the domain name?
The domain name (foobar.com) provides a human-readable address to access the server, instead of using the IP (8.8.8.8). It’s easier to remember.

What type of DNS record is www in www.foobar.com?
The www is a DNS A record (Address record) that maps the subdomain www to the IP 8.8.8.8.

What is the role of the web server (Nginx)?
Nginx handles HTTP(S) requests from clients. It:

Serves static content (HTML, CSS, JS).

Forwards dynamic requests (like .php) to the application server.

Handles things like load balancing, SSL termination, and URL rewriting (though we’re not using those in this simple setup).

What is the role of the application server?
The application server executes your code. For example, with PHP:

When a user visits /profile.php, Nginx passes the request to PHP-FPM.

PHP interprets the script, interacts with the database, and returns HTML to Nginx.

What is the role of the database?
MySQL stores persistent data like:

User accounts

Orders

Blog posts

Any data your application uses

What is the server using to communicate with the user's computer?
The server communicates using HTTP or HTTPS protocols over TCP/IP. The user’s browser sends HTTP requests, and the server responds with HTTP responses.
